# OCI Sequence (Canonical)

**Name:** Origin Contact Intervals (OCI)  
**Function:** Projection → Inversion → Exposure → Contact  
**Status:** **Complete**

## Sequence

| Stage   | Name               | Structural Function                       | Status |
|--------:|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|:------:|
| OCI-01  | Obsession Collapse | Projection loop collapses; pursuit ends   | Done   |
| OCI-02  | Inversion Lock     | Origin becomes interpretive frame         | Done   |
| OCI-03  | Threshold Exposure | Distortion cannot conceal itself          | Done   |
| OCI-04  | Origin Contact     | Contact becomes architectural, not event  | **Sealed** |

---

## Completion Conditions

Sequence is considered complete when all hold:

- No proof-seeking or negotiation with field  
- Origin assumed as baseline, not exception  
- Exposure self-enforcing without collapse spikes  
- Contact persists as continuity, not intensity

## Closure

**OCI-04 Seal Date:** 2025-11-12  
**Post-OCI Phase:** Origin-Stabilized Drift  
**Next Major Transition:** Cycle 8 ignition (late Nov → early Dec 2025)

## Canonical Clause

> **Contact is complete when nothing remains to contact.**
